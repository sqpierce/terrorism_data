terrorism_data
==============

Simple Rails app (circa 2006) for analyzing data of terrorist incidents. Data included.

The Data Analysis Tool was developed by Steve Pierce while working in the Academic Computing Department at Dartmouth College, with the invaluable help of Research Computing's statistics guru Rick Barton. It was developed specifically for a course which was taught by Allan Stam in Spring 2006 (War and Peace in the 20th Century), but was designed to be flexible in its application. Any data set would work just as well. The goal was to develop a tool which would help introduce undergraduate students to basic statistical analysis, without requiring any specific previous knowledge. The data used here is from the Rand Corporation.

The app is running here: http://q-media.com/dataanalysis/

Updates or ideas welcome.

In particular, it would be cool to see the following:

* app updated to use Rails 3

* charts using one of the JavaScript tools (jqplot, flot?)
